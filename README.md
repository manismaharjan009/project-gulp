Actullay what is an automation tool?
Build tools are the frontend helper tool that helps us to automate development process.
Mainly they helps in Development, Testing, Optimization and Deployment.
Mainly there are two kinds of build tools:

GUI (eg codekit, prepos),
CLI (eg grunt, gulp)

Both of them do things like sass compilation , browser refresh when file is saved, test for javascript error using jshint, and optimize most of your assets.

But GUI has their limitation as per their use, so if we need something aside from these, only CLI would be helpful because we can customize our need as we need like we can make up our build process. Thus CLI are much more powerful as comared to GUI tools.

The two most commonly used CLI tool are grunt and gulp.
  
  
Here I will be presenting with Gulp tool with some drawback over Grunt.
